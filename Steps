Steps for Building the Handwritten Character Recognition System:
Data Collection: You can use publicly available datasets like the EMNIST (Extended MNIST) dataset or MNIST itself, which contains a large number of handwritten characters.

Preprocessing:

Resize and normalize the images.
Apply necessary transformations like grayscale conversion and image binarization.
Model Building: Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize the handwritten characters.

Training the Model: Train the model using the training dataset, validating it on the test dataset.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict handwritten characters.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance using accuracy metrics.
